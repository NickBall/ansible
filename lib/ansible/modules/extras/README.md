ansible-modules-core
====================

This repo is transitional and not yet enabled.  Do not send issues or pull requests here yet.

The goal is to split library/ from ansible into git submodules. 

Take care to submit tickets to the appropriate repo where modules are contained. The docs.ansible.com website indicates this at the bottom of each module documentation page.
